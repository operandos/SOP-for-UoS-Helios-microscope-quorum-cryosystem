## 1.1 SEM chamber set-up
> **Warning** : **Wear gloves whenever handling anything that will be under vacuum in the SEM chamber !**  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; This manages grease being transferred to surfaces in the chamber where it can build up and impact the vacuum & contamination conditions.  

### Remove the non-cryo specimen stage
Unscrew the top of the specimen stage while holding the bottom threaded part. Once the top part of the specimen stage is loose, the whole stage can be removed leaving the flush SEM stage plate.  
Store the non-cryo stage in the silver toolbox on the prep table.
### Fit the cryostage base and cryostage
The base of the cryostage is kept outside the SEM in the silver toolbox on the prep table. The three attachment bolts are kept with the cryostage base.  

The cryostage is kept in a recess in the left of the SEM chamber [FIGURE]. It can not be removed due to the fixed N2 lines.  
Fix the cryostage to the crystage base with three screws, in the position shown in the [FIGURE].  

> **Warning** : **Line the cryostage up with the direction that samples are transferred into the chamber !**  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise it is impossible to transfer the sample into the chamber.  

### Position the SEM Anticontaminator
The SEM Anticontaminator is folded away at the back right of the SEM chamber.  
For cryo-operation, it should be positioned parallel with the pole piece, with the tip of the SEM Anticontaminator no more than 1 cm away from polepiece [FIGURE].  

> **Warning** : **Do not touch anything in the chamber except the SEM Anticontaminator !**

> **Warning** : **Do not block the plasma cleaner feedthrough in the back right of the SEM chamber !**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; The feedthrough for the plasma cleaner is a circular recess also in the back right of the SEM chamber.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not block this when folding the SEM anticontaminator away as plasma cleaning functions will not work.  

## 1.2 Evacuating the heat exchanger N2 lines  
Before filling the 21L LN2 (liquid nitrogen) dewar, the N2 lines to the SEM chamber must be evacuated so that there is no moistue around the lines.  
This is done by following the steps:
  - attach the pumpout valve to the top of the cryogenic heat exchanger (CHE300) [FIGURE].  
  - push screw rod in and tighten to finger tight.  
  - now pull out the rod top open the valve and turn it so that it sits on a crenalation (this leaves the valve open during evacuation).  
  - on the cryosystem controller PC go to `Vacuum functions` > `evacuate lines`.  
  - evacuate until in green range of vaccum gauge then `cancel` the `evacuate lines` operation.  

## 1.3 Filling the LN2 containers
LN2 (liquid nitrogen) containers associated with the cryosystem are the 21L dewar (with CHE3000 cryogenic heat exchanger) and 60L boiloff tank (to provide N2 gas).  
> **Note**
> : **The 60L boiloff tank is filled ahead of the session by Sorby Centre staff.**  

### Filling the 21L dewar
**If filling the 21L dewar, review the RA (risk assessment) and LN2 CoSHH [link to CoSHH] !**  
With help, carry the 21L dewar into the LG32 prep lab where it will be filled, and open the external door (for increased air flow).  
Using an LN2 bucket, take LN2 from the stock in the Sorby corridor and fill the 21L dewar. 
> **Note** : **Use a funnel (found by LN2 stock) to fill the 21L dewar.**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; The 21L dewar is full at 26 cm LN2 depth, which is enough for ~ 2.5 days of cryosystem operation.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Measure by putting a plastic ruler (kept in the Helios room, LG39) into the filled 21L dewar so that it touches the bottom of the dewar.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Withdraw the ruler. Ice will form on the part of the ruler that was submerged in LN2.  

With help, carry the 21L dewar back to LG39 and install the heat exchanger (CHE3000) in the 20L dewar. The N2 lines must be evacuated beforehand.  
The heat exchanger will fit flush with the top of the dewar neck.  

### Regulating the 60L boiloff tank
The 60L boiloff tank has fittings to regulate the N2 pressure.
The Quorum cryosystem requires 2 bar to function.  
The 60L boiloff tank will start venting at 3 bar pressure.  

Pressure is regulated by adjusting flow through the raise pressure loop [FIGURE].  
Adjust this in half turns and wait ~1 minute between adjustments as there is a delayed effect.  

> **Note**
>  : **Try to keep the 60L boiloff tank between 2-2.5 bar pressure.**  

> **Warning**
> : **When leaving the 60L boiloff tank overnight, fully close the raise pressure loop !**

## 1.4 Cooling the cryosystem  
Now the system components are set up, the SEM anticontaminator, cryostage, prep-stage and prep anticontaminator can be cooled.

  1. Go to `Temp and Flow` and ensure the `Gas Flow` is set to 0.00 and the mode is `Gas Flow Manual` (toggle between manual and auto modes).  
  2. `Set T` with these values:  

| SEM Anticontaminator | Cryostage | Prep-stage | Prep Anticontaminator |  
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| -185 <sup>o</sup>C | -160 <sup>o</sup>C | -160 <sup>o</sup>C |  -185 <sup>o</sup>C |  

> **Note**
> : **Always set the anticontaminators to a lower temperature than the associated stage.**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Contamination will deposit preferentially on the anticontaminator rather than the specimen.  

  3. Toggle `Gas Flow Auto` to begin cooling.  
The maximum flow rate is 5, although in `Gas Flow Auto` mode it can be slightly more.
The `Actual T` readings will begin to drop. The flow rate will be automatically regulated to achieve the `Set T`.
