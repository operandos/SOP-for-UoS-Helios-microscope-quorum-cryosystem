## 1.1 SEM chamber set-up
### Remove the non-cryo specimen stage
**Wear gloves whenever handling anything that will be under vacuum in the SEM chamber !**  
This stops grease build up impacting the vacuum & contamination conditions.  
Unscrew the top of the specimen stage while holding the bottom threaded part. Once the top part of the specimen stage is loose, the whole stage can be removed leaving the flush SEM stage plate.  
Store the non-cryo stage in the silver toolbox on the prep table.
### Fit the cryostage
The base of the cryostage is kept outside the SEM in the silver toolbox on the prep table. The three attachment bolts are kept with the cryostage base.  
Fit the cryostage base to the SEM stage plate.
The cryostage is kept in a recess in the left of the SEM chamber [FIGURE]. It can not be removed due to the fixed N2 lines.  
Fix the cryostage to the crystage base with three screws, in the position shown in the [FIGURE].  
*It is important to line the cryostage up with the direction that samples are transferred into the chamber!*
