## 1.1 SEM chamber set-up
> **Wear gloves whenever handling anything that will be under vacuum in the SEM chamber !**  
This stops grease build up impacting the vacuum & contamination conditions.  

### Remove the non-cryo specimen stage
Unscrew the top of the specimen stage while holding the bottom threaded part. Once the top part of the specimen stage is loose, the whole stage can be removed leaving the flush SEM stage plate.  
Store the non-cryo stage in the silver toolbox on the prep table.
### Fit the cryostage base and cryostage
The base of the cryostage is kept outside the SEM in the silver toolbox on the prep table. The three attachment bolts are kept with the cryostage base.  

The cryostage is kept in a recess in the left of the SEM chamber [FIGURE]. It can not be removed due to the fixed N2 lines.  
Fix the cryostage to the crystage base with three screws, in the position shown in the [FIGURE].  
*It is important to line the cryostage up with the direction that samples are transferred into the chamber!*  

## 1.2 Evacuating the heat exchanger N2 lines  
Before filling the 21L LN2 (liquid nitrogen) dewar, the N2 lines to the SEM chamber must be evacuated so that there is no moistue around the lines.  
This is done by following the steps:
  - attach the pumpout valve to the top of the cryogenic heat exchanger (CHE300) [FIGURE].  
  - push screw rod in and tighten to finger tight.  
  - now pull out the rod top open the valve and turn it so that it sits on a crenalation (this leaves the valve open during evacuation).  
  - on the cryosystem controller PC go to `Vacuum functions` > `evacuate lines`.  
  - evacuate until in green range of vaccum gauge then cancel the `evacuate lines` operation.  

## 1.3 Filling the LN2 containers
LN2 (liquid nitrogen) containers associated with the cryosystem are the 21L dewar (with CHE3000 cryogenic heat exchanger) and 60L boiloff tank (to provide N2 gas).  
The 60L boiloff tank is filled ahead of the session by Sorby Centre staff.  

### Filling the 21L dewar
**If filling the 21L dewar, review the RA (risk assessment) and LN2 CoSHH [link to CoSHH] !**  
With help, carry the 21L dewar into the LG32 prep lab where it will be filled, and open the external door (for increased air flow).  
Using an LN2 bucket, take LN2 from the stock in the Sorby corridor and fill the 21L dewar.  
> Full is 26 cm on the plastic ruler (kept in the Helios room, LG39), which is enough for ~ 2.5 days of cryosystem operation.

With help, carry the 21L dewar back to LG39 and install the heat exchanger (CHE3000) in the 20L dewar. The N2 lines must be evacuated beforehand.  
The heat exchanger will fit flush with the top of the dewar neck.  

### Regulating the 60L boiloff tank
The 60L boiloff tank has fittings to regulate the N2 pressure.
The Quorum cryosystem requires ?2 mbar? to function.  
The 60L boiloff tank will start venting at 3 mbar pressure.  

Pressure is regulated by adjusting flow through the raise pressure loop [FIGURE].  
Adjust this in half turns and wait ~1 minute between adjustments as there is a delayed effect.  
Try to keep the 60L boiloff tank between 2-2.5 mbar pressure.  
**When leaving the 60L boiloff tank overnight, fully close the raise pressure loop.**
