## 1.1 SEM chamber set-up
> **Wear gloves whenever handling anything that will be under vacuum in the SEM chamber !**  
This stops grease build up impacting the vacuum & contamination conditions.  

### Remove the non-cryo specimen stage
Unscrew the top of the specimen stage while holding the bottom threaded part. Once the top part of the specimen stage is loose, the whole stage can be removed leaving the flush SEM stage plate.  
Store the non-cryo stage in the silver toolbox on the prep table.
### Fit the cryostage base and cryostage
The base of the cryostage is kept outside the SEM in the silver toolbox on the prep table. The three attachment bolts are kept with the cryostage base.  

The cryostage is kept in a recess in the left of the SEM chamber [FIGURE]. It can not be removed due to the fixed N2 lines.  
Fix the cryostage to the crystage base with three screws, in the position shown in the [FIGURE].  
*It is important to line the cryostage up with the direction that samples are transferred into the chamber!*  

## 1.2 Evacuating the heat exchanger N2 lines  
Before filling the 21L LN2 (liquid nitrogen) dewar, the N2 lines to the SEM chamber must be evacuated so that there is no moistue around the lines.  
This is done by following the steps:
  - attach the pumpout valve to the top of the cryogenic heat exchanger (CHE300) [FIGURE].  
  - push screw rod in and tighten to finger tight.  
  - now pull out the rod top open the valve and turn it so that it sits on a crenalation (this leaves the valve open during evacuation).  
  - on the cryosystem controller PC go to `Vacuum functions` > `evacuate lines`.  
  - evacuate until in green range of vaccum gauge then cancel the `evacuate lines` operation.  

## 1.3 Filling the LN2 containers
LN2 (liquid nitrogen) containers associated with the cryosystem are the 21L dewar (with CHE3000 cryogenic heat exchanger) and 60L boiloff tank (to provide N2 gas).  
The 60L boiloff tank is filled ahead of the session by Sorby Centre staff.  

### Filling the 21L dewar
**If filling the 21L dewar, review the RA (risk assessment) and LN2 CoSHH [link to CoSHH] !**  

### Regulating the 60L boiloff tank
