## 2.1 Sample
### 2.1.1 Slushing
### 2.1.2 Cryo-fracture
With the sample in the prep chamber (see section [2.1.3 Transfer](https://github.com/operandos/SOP-for-UoS-Helios-microscope-quorum-cryosystem/blob/main/2.%20Cryosystem%20operation.md#213-transfer))
### 2.1.3 Transfer
> **Note** : **If the transfer rod is not running smoothly, add some lubrication. It will make transfers much easier.**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Vacuum grease is in a small dropper bottle on the slushing table. Apply a few drops on the rod near the seel.  

> **Note** : **Practice connecting and disconnecting the bayonet from the specimen shuttle outside the cryosystem first.**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Pay attention to the orientation of the paddle at the end of the rod you are holding.  

#### Connecting to and disconnecting the specimen shuttle  

#### Into the prep chamber  
  1. Attach the Quorum transfer module to the prep chamber.  
    - if the metal cover is attached to the airlock, this needs to be removed first.  
    - Press the *Vent* button on the prep chamber to release the metal cover.  
    - Now you can attach the transfer module.  
  3. Press the airlock *Pump* button.  
  4. Open the transfer module antechamber valve.  
    - this is with the rod that is in locked position (parallel with transfer rod) on the transfer chamber
    - fold the rod and then rotate anticlockwise until it stops
  5. *Pump* the airlock again before opening the valve to the prep chamber.  
    - you just opened the transfer chamber antechamber which is at lower vacuum than the prep chamber.  
    - a green light will come on when you can proceed to step 5.  
      - you may need to do this twice if it does not achieve the sufficient vacuum level the first time.  
  6. open the valve to the prep chamber  
    - rotate the locking sleave clockwise until it stops.  
    - pull down on the locking sleave to open the airlock.  

#### In/out of the SEM chamber  
Once the transfer module is mounted and the transfer rod is in the prep chamber:
  1. Turn off the beam.  
    - which we de-link Z (ie. working distance)
  2. Move the stage to Z = 0.  
> **Warning** : **Always turn off the beam before moving the stage to Z = 0 !**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Z must be de-linked. **You don't want to move to working distance = 0 !**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; **If you do not de-link Z and crash the stage and we will be very angry !** :angry:  

  3. Move the stage to:  
  > X = -18  
  > Y = &nbsp; 18  
  > ( Z is already at 0)  

> **Note** : **You can save this (X,Y) position in the microscope controller software to make it easier to go to these coordinates.**  

  4. In the `Functions` bar, press `Transfer`.  
    - if the prep chamber vacuum is high enough, the green light on the SEM chamber interlock will come on.  
    - if not below 1E-05, you will have to wait for a higher vacuum.  
  5. Open the valve to the prep chamber  
    - rotate the locking sleave clockwise until it stops.  
    - pull down on the locking sleave to open the airlock.  
  6. Looking down the path of the transfer rod:  
    - if moving a sample in, manouvre the specimen shuttle into the cryostage bay.  
    - if retreving a sample, gently push the bayonet into the specimen shuttle.  
  8. Connect/disconnect from the specimen shuttle by rotating the rod 90 degrees counter clockwise and retracting the rod.  
> **Warning** : **To avoid accidentally disconnecting from the specimen shuttle pay attention to the rotation position of the bayonet !**  

> **Note** : **The end of the rod you are holding has an indicator for the rotation position of the bayonet.**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; indicates the bayonet is locked to the specimen shuttle.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; indicates the bayonet can be removed from the specimen shuttle.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Practice connecting and disconnecting the bayonet from the specimen shuttle on the slushing table first.  

  8. Retract the transfer rod from the SEM chamber.  
  9. Close the SEM chamber interlock.  

#### Out of the prep chamber  
  1. Retract the transfer rod fully.
  2. Close the prep chamber airlock.
  3. Press the *Vent* button on the prep chamber.  
  4. Disconect the transfer module.
  5. Replace the metal cover on the airlock and press the *Pump* button.
