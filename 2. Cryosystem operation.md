## 2.1 Sample
### 2.1.1 Slushing
### 2.1.2 Cryo-fracture
With the sample in the prep chamber (see section [2.1.3 Transfer](https://github.com/operandos/SOP-for-UoS-Helios-microscope-quorum-cryosystem/blob/main/2.%20Cryosystem%20operation.md#213-transfer))
### 2.1.3 Transfer
#### Attaching the specimen shuttle  

#### Into the prep chamber  
  1. Attach the Quorum transfer module to the prep chamber.  
  2. Press the airlock *Pump* button.  
  3. Open the transfer module antechamber valve.  
    - this is with the rod that is in locked position (parallel with transfer rod) on the transfer chamber
    - fold the rod and then rotate anticlockwise until it stops
  4. *Pump* the airlock again before opening the valve to the prep chamber.  
    - you just opened the transfer chamber antechamber which is at lower vacuum than the prep chamber.  
    - a green light will come on when you can proceed to step 5.  
      - you may need to do this twice if it does not achieve the sufficient vacuum level the first time.  
  6. open the valve to the prep chamber  
    - rotate the locking sleave clockwise until it stops.  
    - pull down on the locking sleave to open the airlock.  

#### In/out of the SEM chamber  
Once the transfer module is mounted and the transfer rod is in the prep chamebr:
  1. Turn off the beam.  
    - which we de-link Z (ie. working distance)
  2. Move the stage to Z = 0.  
> **Warning** : **Always turn off the beam before moving the stage to Z = 0 !**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Z must be de-linked. **You don't want to move to working distance = 0 !**  
  3. Move the stage to:  
  > X = -18  
  > Y = &nbsp; 18  

> **Note** : **You can save this position in the microscope controller software to make it easier to go to these coordinates.**  

  4. In the `Functions` bar, press `Transfer`.  
    - if the prep chamber vacuum is high enough, the green light on the SEM chamber interlock will come on.  
    - if not below 1E-05, you will have to wait for a higher vacuum.  
  5. open the valve to the prep chamber  
    - rotate the locking sleave clockwise until it stops.  
    - pull down on the locking sleave to open the airlock.  
  6. Looking down the path of the transfer rod:  
    - if moving a sample in, manouvre the specimen shuttle into the cryostage bay.  
    - if retreving a sample, gently push the bayonet into the specimen shuttle.  
  8. Connect/disconnect from the specimen shuttle by rotating the rod 90 degrees counter clockwise and retracting the rod.  
> **Note** : **The end of the rod you are holding has an indicator for the rotation of the bayonet.**  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; | indicates the bayonet is locked to the sample shuttle.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; - indicates the bayonet can be removed from the sample shuttle.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Practice connecting and disconnecting the bayonet from the specimen shuttle on the slushing table first.  

  8. Retract the transfer rod fully.  
  9. Close the SEM chamber interlock and prep chamber airlock.  
  10. Press the *Vent* button on the prep chamber.  
  11. Disconect the transfer module.
  12. Replace the metal cover on the airlock and press the *Pump* button.  


#### Out of the prep chamber
