## 2.1 Sample
### 2.1.1 Slushing
### 2.1.2 Cryo-fracture
### 2.1.3 Transfer
#### Into the SEM chamber  
  1. Attach the Quorum transfer module to the prep chamber.  
  2. Press the airlock *Pump* button.  
  3. Open the transfer module antechamber valve.  
    - this is with the rod that is in locked position (parallel with transfer rod) on the transfer chamber
    - fold the rod and then rotate anticlockwise until it stops
  4. *Pump* the airlock again before opening the valve to the prep chamber.  
    - you just opened the transfer chamber antechamber which is at lower vacuum than the prep chamber.  
    - a green light will come on when you can proceed to step 3.  
      - you may need to do this twice if it does not achieve the sufficient vacuum level the first time.  
  5. Open the transfer module antechamber valve  
  6. open the valve to the prep chamber  
    - rotate the locking sleave clockwise until it stops.  
    - pull down on the locking sleave to open the airlock.  

#### In/out of the SEM chamber  
Any time the sample is being transferred between the SEM chamber and prep chamber,
Turn off the beam and move the stage to:
> X = -18  
> Y = &nbsp; 18  
> Z = &nbsp; 0
